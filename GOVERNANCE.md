# Governance

ModelSpec is currently stewarded by the ParallelIQ team.

Decisions about:
- schema evolution  
- backward compatibility  
- example inclusion  
- versioning  

are made by the maintainers with an emphasis on:
- clarity  
- stability  
- real-world applicability  

## Philosophy

ModelSpec favors:
- explicit intent over implicit assumptions  
- minimalism over completeness  
- stability over rapid churn  

*Breaking changes will only occur with a new apiVersion.*

## Future Direction

As adoption grows, governance may evolve toward a more community-driven model. Any such changes will be discussed openly.
