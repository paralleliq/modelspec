# Contributing to ModelSpec

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

ModelSpec is an open specification, and we welcome thoughtful contributions that improve clarity, usability, and real-world applicability.

## Ways to Contribute

You can help by:
- Reporting issues or ambiguities in the spec or examples  
- Suggesting improvements to the schema or documentation  
- Adding or refining example ModelSpec files  
- Improving explanations or tutorials

## Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure that contributions:
- **Keep ModelSpec declarative** – avoid adding deployment, orchestration, or enforcement logic  
- **Remain platform-agnostic** – do not tie the spec to any specific runtime or vendor  
- **Are documented** – explain the rationale for changes or additions  

When in doubt, open an issue for discussion before submitting a PR.
